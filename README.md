## Introduction

The goal of this presentation is to provide Bistrack BI developers with a set of tools to help solve real problems with actionable data. Much of the focus will be on web-based technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JSON. As Bistrack continues to mature as a web platform, this tech stack is all the more relevant.

As each business is unique and one-size-fits-all applications rarely work for everyone, we hope to provide tools instead of full-blown applications. Thus, the provided examples will be minimialist to outline a concept. Some assembly required.
